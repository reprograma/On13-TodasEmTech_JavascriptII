            <h1 class="section__title">The movement</h1>
            <p class="section__paragraph">For nearly half of Britney Spears's decades-long career as a world-renowned pop star, the "Womanizer" singer hasn't held full control of her life.</p>

            <p class="section__paragraph">Britney has been under a conservatorship helmed by her father, Jamie Spears, since the singer's infamous breakdown 12 years ago, which resulted in hospitalization and rehab. Though the stigma surrounding Spears's mental health battles has followed the singer since 2007, her career never faltered. Marking an official comeback with her 2008 album, Circus, Britney continued to release albums, tour, star in a years-long Las Vegas residency, and launch business ventures including her lucrative perfume and namesake lingerie lines.</p>

            <p class="section__paragraph">According to CNN, during a September 29 court hearing and following a passionate address from Britney Spears's attorney, Mathew Rosengart, Jamie Spears was officially suspended as the conservator of his daughter's estate. Certified public accountant John Zabel has been named a temporary conservator following Jamie's suspension. Jodi Montgomery also remains the conservator of Britney's person.</p>
